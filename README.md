=================

The PayPal Here SDK enables iOS apps to interact with credit card swipers so that merchants can process in-person credit card transactions using a mobile app. The native libraries of the PayPal Here SDK enable you to:
* **Interact with PayPal Hardware** — Detect, connect to, and listen for events coming from PayPal Here audio jack-based card swipers.
* **Process Card-Present payments** — When you swipe a card through a PayPal Here swiper, card data is immediately encrypted. The encrypted package can be sent to PayPal alongside the transaction data for processing.

Full class and method documentation can be [found here](http://paypal-mobile.github.com/ios-here-sdk-dist/index.html).

As an alternative to the SDK, a developer can also use a URI framework that lets one app (or mobile webpage) link directly to the PayPal Here app to complete a payment.  Using this method, the merchant will tap a button or link in one app, which will open the pre-installed PayPal Here app on their device, with the PayPal Here app pre-populating the original order information, collect a payment (card swipe) in the PayPal Here app, and return the merchant to the original app/webpage. This is available for US, UK, Austalia, and Japan for iOS & Android.  See the [Sideloader API](https://github.com/paypal/here-sideloader-api-samples) on Github.


Prerequisites For Using The SDK
===============================

In order to start using the PayPal Here SDK, you need the following:

1. A developer-enabled PayPal account ([sign up here](https://developer.paypal.com/webapps/developer/applications/myapps)).  This is the account you use to register your app.  You will receive an App ID & Secret to use with the SDK.
2. A PayPal Here business account ([sign up here] (https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mobilemerchant/page/mpa/ob/geturl?onbver=2.0&amp;country.x=US&productIntentID=mobile_payment_acceptance&referringpage=ios_sdk_github&hs=login)).  This is the account that the end merchant uses, and will be the destination account of funds received. A single app can be associated with/used by one or many merchant accounts – including the developer-enabled account.  You will receive an Access Token and Refresh URL for each merchant that grants permission to your app.
3. A PayPal Here swiper.  You can get one shipped to you when you create a business account in step (2), or via retailers like [Staples](http://www.staples.com/PayPal-Here-trade-Mobile-Card-Reader/product_1421621).
4. Apple development tools: Xcode 5.1, and an Apple developer account.

The Sample App
==============
To make it easier to see and understand how to best use the capabilities of the SDK, we’ve designed a sample/reference application.  To make the app functional, there is some minimal UI code that can be ignored – the point is to show how to use the SDK API’s.

With the Sample App, you can view code that:
* Initializes the SDK
* Authenticates the merchant
* Updates the merchant location
* Creates & adds items to an invoice
* Takes a payment with the card reader
* Takes a keyed-in card transaction
* Add a signature to finalize a payment
* Send an email/SMS receipt 


Get Started
===========
The first thing you need to do is set up your app to start using the SDK.  
* Initialize the SDK (each time the app starts) 
* Authenticate the merchant and pass the merchant’s credentials (Access Token) to the SDK [(more on PayPal oAuth)](/docs/PayPal%20Access%20oAuth.md)
* Set the merchant’s location (any time the merchant’s location changes) 
* Start monitoring the card reader for events (for card present transactions)

If you want to start with test transactions (generally a good idea), you can optionally send a selectEnvironmentWithType message to PayPalHereSDK: 
```objectivec
	[PayPalHereSDK selectEnvironmentWithType:environment_type] 
```
* *environment_type* is **ePPHSDKServiceType_Sandbox** for the Sandbox environment, or **ePPHSDKServiceType_Live** for the live environment (default).

With an authenticated merchant, it calls PayPalHereSDK.setActiveMerchant to set the merchant for which transactions will be executed. 
```objectivec
	[PayPalHereSDK setActiveMerchant:merchant withMerchantId:merchantId completionHander:handler] 
```
* *merchant* is an instance of the PPHMerchantInfo represeting a merchant object
* *merchantId* is an id for the merchant. It is defined by agreement between the back-end server and the app (not by the SDK), and must be unique among the merchants that use the back-end server and the app.
* *handler* is an id for a completion handler to be called when merchant setup is completed.

Now, monitor the card reader for events like reader connections, removals, and swipes. Invoke the  API
(SettingsViewController.m). 
```objectivec
	[[PayPalHereSDK sharedCardReaderManager] beginMonitoring];
```

Code Worth Looking At
=====================
Card reader interaction is established by calling
```objectivec
    [[PayPalHereSDK sharedCardReaderManager] beginMonitoring];
```
which will monitor for all card reader types. If you want to monitor for a subset of types - such as audio 
readers only, use the beginMonitoring overload that takes a PPHReaderTypeMask.

Once you've begun monitoring, the SDK will start firing notification center events for relevant card events.
However, we recommend you do not monitor the notification center directly, but instead use our class that
will translate untyped notification center calls to typed delegate calls. You do this by simply storing an
instance of PPHCardReaderWatcher in your class and implementing the PPHCardReaderDelegate protocol.
```objectivec
    self.readerWatcher = [[PPHCardReaderWatcher alloc] initWithDelegate: self];
```
If you're not using EMV readers, the events are very simple:

```objectivec
-(void)didStartReaderDetection: (PPHReaderType) readerType;
-(void)didDetectReaderDevice: (PPHCardReaderBasicInformation*) reader;
-(void)didReceiveCardReaderMetadata: (PPHCardReaderMetadata*) metadata;
-(void)didRemoveReader: (PPHReaderType) readerType;

-(void)didDetectCardSwipeAttempt;
-(void)didCompleteCardSwipe:(PPHCardSwipeData*)card;
-(void)didFailToReadCard;
```

The first four relate to the insertion, removal and detection of the card reader, the other three are in
the context of a transaction, which you must "begin" by telling the card reader manager you're ready to
receive a swipe. Because some readers (namely audio jack readers) have batteries in them, you MUST
be careful about when you activate the reader. In the PayPal Here app, for example, we activate the reader
when there is a non-zero value in the "cart" or active order. If you have a view or step which expresses clear
intent to take a charge, that's a good time to activate the reader. To activate the reader, call beginTransaction:

    [[PayPalHereSDK sharedCardReaderManager] beginTransaction: invoice];

The invoice is a PPHInvoice, and doesn't need to have been saved to the PayPal backend to begin watching
for card swipes. It will need to be saved before attempting a charge, but you can do this in parallel with
receiving swipe data. To create an invoice, just set up a currency, add one or more items, and set tax or other
information:

```objectivec
PPHInvoice *invoice = [[PPHInvoice alloc] initWithCurrency:self.currencyField.text];

[invoice addItemWithId: @"Item"
                   name: @"Purchase"
               quantity: [NSDecimalNumber one]
              unitPrice: [PPHAmount amountWithString:self.amountField.text inCurrency:self.currencyField.text].amount
                taxRate: nil
            taxRateName: nil];
```

You should add details about each item on the receipt if possible. To save an invoice, just call save and provide
a completion handler. Typically you would show some progress UI while doing this, unless it's being done in the
background:

        [invoice save:^(PPHError *error) {
          // If error is non-nil, something bad happened. Else, invoice has been updated with server info
          // such as PayPal invoice id, auto-generated merchant reference number, etc.
        }

This must be done before you pay an invoice. To pay an invoice with the result of a card
swipe, you must first gather the signature image (the PPHSignatureView can be placed in a view controller of your
own design and it will provide an image which can be sent to the API). At the moment, for historical reasons,
the signature must be captured BEFORE submitting the transaction for payment. We are actively attempting to fix this.

```objectivec
[[PayPalHereSDK sharedPaymentProcessor]
        beginCardPresentChargeAttempt: card
                           forInvoice: invoice
                        withSignature: signatureView
                        completionHandler: ^(PPHCardChargeResponse* response) {
                            // if response.error is nil, the charge worked and you can store the
                            // response.transactionId for correlation later (and refunds)
                        }];
```



The PPHTransactionManager - the Composition Layer
=================================================

   A payment API is also provided called the PPHTransactionManager.
The PPHTransactionManager takes care of some details for you - it's possible to take a card swipe payment without having to explicitly save the invoice or to use the card reader API to capture card events.   This comes at the cost of less control over the step by step process.  
   If you do want to see all the card swiper events you still can create a card watcher and get all the card events while using the PPHTransactionManager at the same time.

How to use it?

First, create a PPHTransactionWatcher object so you can get notified when the transaction manager does something.  Retain this object for the lifetime over which you would like to interact with the PPHTransactionManager:
```objectivec
PPHTransactionWatcher *transactionWatcher = [[PPHTransactionWatcher alloc] initWithDelegate:self];
```

Second, start your payment.  Here's an example of taking a payment for a fixed amount ($5):

```objectivec
[[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] beginPaymentWithAmount:[PPHAmount amountWithString:amountString inCurrency:@"USD"] andName:@"FixedAmountPayment"];
```


Then … wait for the user to swipe a card.   You do that by capturing the ePPHTransactionType_CardDataReceived event from the PPHTransacitonWatcher:

```objectivec
#pragma mark my PPHTransactionManagerDelegate overrides
- (void)onPaymentEvent:(PPHTransactionManagerEvent *) event {
  if(event.eventType == ePPHTransactionType_CardDataReceived) {
      NSLog(@"The transaction manager has card data!");
      // We're now clear to process the payment
  }
}
```

Now that you know the card has been captured you can ask the PPHTransactionWatcher to process the payment:
```objectivec
[[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] processPaymentWithPaymentType:ePPHPaymentMethodSwipe
                  withTransactionController:nil
                          completionHandler:^(PPHTransactionResponse *response) {
                              if(!record.error) {
                                  self.successfulResponse = response;
                                  NSLog(@"Payment captured successfully!  We now have the money in our account!");

if(response.isSignatureRequiredToFinalize) {
   NSLog(@"This payment requires a signature.  Let's provide one via the finalizePayment method");

}                              
                              }
                          }];
```

If you would like to supply a signature you can do so after the processPayment's completion handler successfully returns:

```objectivec
UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithData:imageData];                              
PPHTransactionRecord *transactionRecord = self.successfulResponse.record;
UIImage *signature = [self mySignatureImage];

[[PayPalHereSDK sharedTransactionManager] finalizePaymentForTransaction:transactionRecord                                                           withSignature:image  
completionHandler:^(PPHError *error) {
                                                             
if(error == nil) {
   NSLog(@"signature successfully sent.");
															}
}];
```

Required signatures and the PPHTransactionManager
=================================================

Some transactions require a signature.  This may happen for several reasons.  The transaction amount might be over a certain limit, or the card swiper / chip & pin reader hardware may require it based on a variety of reasons.   The PPHTransactionManager can inform you if a signature is required for the payment that is being processed. 
When the processPayment method's completion handler is called you can check the isSignatureRequiredToFinalize member of the PPHTransactionResponse object that is provided to the completion handler. 

<!--- Removing Location/Checkin References
Location Management
===================

The SDK also presents an interface for managing PayPal tab payments (aka Checkin) and the merchant locations
associated with those payments. You can create a location from scratch, or get current locations and modify
properties (such as latitude and longitude, whether it's open, and etc.). You can watch for open tabs on a
location (by polling) using the PPHLocalManager watcherForLocationId:withDelegate: method. The code below fetches
the list of locations and modifies the first location. Then, it creates and saves a location watcher, which
will monitor the location for new tabs. As of this writing, there is no automatic polling, so the update
method must be called to trigger a check for new tabs, and events will be fired as appropriate when that update
completes (error handling in the below example is omitted for readability).

```objectivec
        [[PayPalHereSDK sharedLocalManager] beginGetLocations:^(PPHError *error, NSArray *locations) {
            PPHLocation *l = [locations objectAtIndex:0];

            l.contactInfo.lineOne = @"1 International Place";
            l.contactInfo.city = @"Boston";
            l.contactInfo.state = "MA";
            l.contactInfo.countryCode = @"US";
            l.tabExtensionType = ePPHTabExtensionTypeNone;
            [l save:^(PPHError *error) {
                self.locationWatcher = [[PayPalHereSDK sharedLocalManager] watcherForLocationId:l.locationId withDelegate:self];
                [self.locationWatcher update];
            }];

        }];
```

PayPal Access
=============

In order to authenticate merchants to PayPal and to issue API calls on their behalf for processing payment, you use
PayPal Access, which uses standard OAuth protocols. Basically, you send the merchant to a web page on paypal.com,
they login, and are then redirected back to a URL you control with an "oauth token." That token is then exchanged for
an "access token" which can be used to make API calls on the merchant's behalf. Additionally, a "refresh token" is
returned in that exchange that allows you to get a new access token at some point in the future without merchant
interaction. All of this is based on two pieces of data from your application - an app id and a secret. You can setup
PayPal Access and/or create an application via the [devportal](https://developer.paypal.com/). As of this writing your application will still need to be specifically enabled for the PayPal Here scope. To enable the PayPal Here scopes please contact us at <DL-PayPal-Here-SDK@ebay.com>. 
You'll note that it asks you for a Return URL, and that this Return URL must be http or https. This means you can't
redirect directly back to your mobile app after a login. But the good news is this would be a terrible idea anyways.
You never want to store your application secret on a mobile device - you can't be sure it isn't jailbroken or
otherwise compromised and once it's out there you don't have many good options for updating all your users.
So instead, you need a backend server to host this secret and control the applications usage of OAuth on
behalf of your merchants. While you can use PayPal Access as your sole point of authentication, you likely have an
existing account system of some sort, so you would first authenticate your users to your system, then send them to
PayPal and link up the accounts on their return.

The other good news is that we've included a simple sample implementation of a back end server with the SDK, written
in Node.js which most people should be able to read reasonably easily. The sample server implements four REST service
endpoints:

1. /login - a dummy version of your user authentication. It returns a "secret ticket" that can be used in place of a
password to reassure you that the person you're getting future requests from is the same person that typed in their
password to your application.
2. /goPayPal - validates the ticket and returns a URL which your mobile application can open in Safari to start
the PayPal access flow. This method specifies the OAuth scopes you're interested in, which must include the PayPal
Here scope (https://uri.paypal.com/services/paypalhere) if you want to use PayPal Here APIs.
3. /goApp - when PayPal Access completes and the merchant grants you access, PayPal will return them to this
endpoint, and this endpoint will inspect the result and redirect back to your application. First, the code calls PayPal
to exchange the OAuth token for the access token. The request to do the exchange looks like this:
```javascript
    request.post({
      url:config.PAYPAL_ACCESS_BASEURL + "auth/protocol/openidconnect/v1/tokenservice",
        auth:{
          user:config.PAYPAL_APP_ID,
          pass:config.PAYPAL_SECRET,
          sendImmediately:true
        },
        form:{
          grant_type:"authorization_code",
          code:req.query.code
        }
    }, function (error, response, body) {
    });
```
Now comes the important part. The server encrypts the access token received from PayPal using the client ticket so that
even if someone has hijacked your application's URL handler, the data will be meaningless since it wasn't the one that
sent the merchant to the PayPal Access flow anyways (this implies you chose your ticket well - the sample server doesn't
really do this because there's no backend to speak of, it's just a flat file database). Secondly, it returns a URL
to your mobile application that allows it to generate a refresh token. This URL is to the /refresh handler and
includes the refresh token issued by PayPal encrypted with an "account specific server secret." The refresh token is
never stored on the server, and is not stored in a directly usable form on the client either. This minimizes the value
of centralized data on your server, and allows you to cutoff refresh tokens at will in cases of client compromise.
4. /refresh/username/token - This handler decrypts the refresh token and calls the token service to get a new
access token given that refresh token.

To setup the server you need to setup your ReturnURL in PayPal Access to point to your instance of the sample server.
Assuming you want to test on a device, this URL needs to work on that device and on your simulator typically, meaning
you need a "real" DNS entry somewhere. Hopefully you can do this on your office router, or buy a cheap travel router
and do it there. Alternatively, you could stick the server on heroku or some such. See config.js in the sample-server
directory for the variables you need to set to run the sample server. To run the sample server, after modifying
config.js, install Node.js and run "npm install" in the sample-server directory. Then run "node server.js" and you
should see useful log messages to the console. The server advertises itself using Bonjour/zeroconf, so the sample app
should find it automatically. But again, the return URL in PayPal Access is harder to automate, so you'll need to
configure that once. One instance of the sample server can serve all your developers in theory, so it's easiest to
run it on some shared or external resource.

<!--- Removing Location/Checkin References
Opening Consumer Tabs
=====================
To checkin consumers to merchants, use the checkin.js script in the scripts directory. For example:

```
npm install
node checkin.js --help
node checkin.js -m selleraccount@paypal.com -c buyeraccount@paypal.com -i tombrady.png
```

Use -i to add an image for the buyer - this only needs to be done once. Sometimes it takes a few runs to get through,
and images tend to be very finicky in staging.
